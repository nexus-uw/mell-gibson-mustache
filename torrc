## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
## be at least 20 KB.
## Note that units for these config options are bytes per second, not bits
## per second, and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10, 2^20, etc.
RelayBandwidthRate 4 MBytes  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
RelayBandwidthBurst 7 MBytes # But allow bursts up to 200KB/s (1600Kbps)
AccountingMax 500Gbytes
